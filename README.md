# calendarJQueryMoment
calendar project for school

This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The planner will open to the current day and the current time block will be highlighted in Red. Standard business hour time blocks will be available for scheduling. Time blocks in the past, present and future will be clearly delineated. Time blocks will be able to be written into and that info will be saveable. That info will be saved into local storage. And even after refreshing the page the saved event will persist.
